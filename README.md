# 🤖 MCP File System Assistant

A powerful natural language interface for file system operations using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Talk to your computer's file system using plain English and let AI handle the complex operations for you.

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 **Intelligent File Search**
- **Lightning-fast indexed search** across your entire file system
- **Smart pattern matching** - find files by partial names, content, or patterns  
- **Natural language queries** - "find my latest resume" or "show Python files from last week"
- **Alias support** - use shortcuts like "desktop", "downloads", "documents"

### 📁 **Complete File Operations**
- **Read any text file** - supports 15+ file formats including code, configs, and documents
- **Create files with templates** - Python scripts, HTML pages, Markdown docs, and more
- **Smart editing** - write, append, or modify file contents
- **Safe operations** - confirmation prompts and rollback protection

### 🧠 **AI-Powered Intelligence**
- **Contextual understanding** - knows what you mean even with ambiguous requests

The system uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to create a secure bridge between AI and your file system:

- **MCP Server**: Provides safe, sandboxed file operations
- **AI Client**: Interprets natural language and orchestrates operations  
- **User Interface**: Clean terminal-based interaction

## 🏭 For Developers

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone and setup development environment
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcp-filesystem-assistant.git
cd mcp-filesystem-assistant

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt



### Adding New Tools

1. **Define the tool in `server.py`:**
```python
@mcp.tool()
def my_custom_tool(param1: str, param2: int = 10):
    """Description of what this tool does."""
    # Your implementation here
    return {"result": "success", "data": "..."}
```

2. **Update the client's system prompt** to include the new tool
3. **Test with natural language**: "Use my custom tool with these parameters"

## 📈 Performance

### Benchmarks
- **File search**: < 1 second for 100K+ indexed files
- **File operations**: Near-instant for files < 10MB
- **AI response**: 2-5 seconds depending on query complexity
- **Memory usage**: < 50MB for typical operations

### Optimization Tips
1. **Enable file indexing** - Run "initialize index" on first use
2. **Limit search scope** - Search specific folders instead of entire system
3. **Use specific queries** - "Python files in projects" vs "find files"
4. **Regular cleanup** - Remove old index files and logs periodically

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **Local processing**: All file operations happen on your machine
- **API calls**: Only natural language queries sent to Groq (no file contents)
- **No data collection**: We don't store or transmit your files
- **Audit trail**: Complete logging of all operations

### Safety Features
- **Sandbox protection**: Cannot access system-critical directories
- **Confirmation prompts**: Double-check before destructive operations
- **Rollback capability**: Undo recent file operations
- **Permission respect**: Works within your user account limits

### Network Requirements
- **Internet needed for**: AI processing of natural language queries
- **Offline capability**: File operations work without internet
- **Minimal data usage**: Only text queries sent to API (< 1KB per request)

## Log Files
Check `logs/mcp_assistant.log` for detailed error information.
